                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a widely adopted wireless communication technology used by billions of devices in various applications. These
                            applications range from IoT domain to more sensitive devices such as medical ones.<br>
                            BLE has been subject to a lot of research so far [<a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/garbelini">1</a>, <a href="https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity19/presentation/antonioli">2</a>, <a href="https://www.ieee-security.org/TC/SP2021/SPW2021/WOOT21/files/woot21-claverie-slides.pdf">3</a>], but only a few of them targeted specification corner cases which require high-level
                            manipulation of the GATT layer.</p>
                        <p>Based on that reason, we decided to build a fuzzer based on attack scenarios defined after conducting an in-depth study of the BLE specification.
                            Our work resulted in the discovery of non-conformities, bugs, and vulnerabilities in various BLE stacks.</p>
                        <p>This R&amp;D work was carried out during Baptiste Boyer's internship at Quarkslab.</p>
                        <h2>BLE analysis</h2>
                        <p>The BLE protocol is built upon multiple layers that extend from the radio layer to the application layer as described below:</p>
                        <p><a href="resources/2024-09-18_ble-gatt-fuzzing/ble_stack.png">
                            <img class="align-center" src="resources/2024-09-18_ble-gatt-fuzzing/ble_stack.png" alt="BLE Protocol Stack." width="60%" height="60%"></p>
                        <p class="center-text">BLE Stack</p>
                        <p><br />
                            </a></p>
                        <p>Our study focuses on the Attribute Protocol (ATT) layer and on the Generic Attribute Protocol (GATT) layer.
                            However, it is also important to define the two key components of the BLE framework that are the Host and the Controller.</p>
                        <p>The Host and Controller represent distinct entities with specific roles in
                            the communication process. The Host is typically associated with the device’s
                            primary processing unit, such as a computer or smartphone. It oversees higher
                            layers of the BLE protocol stack, managing connections, configuring parameters,
                            and handling application-specific communication needs. In contrast, the
                            Controller operates at a lower layer, responsible for radio frequency communication aspects.
                            Implemented in specialized hardware, like a Bluetooth chip, the
                            Controller executes tasks such as frequency hopping, modulation, and power
                            control, ensuring reliable and efficient radio communication. To be able to communicate together,
                            they use the Host Controller Interface (HCI).</p>
                        <h3>ATT Layer</h3>
                        <p>The Attribute Protocol (ATT) defines two distinct roles: a server and a client. The server is responsible for storing and managing attributes, while the client accesses and manipulates these attributes. In this context, an attribute is a data representation format composed of four fields.</p>
                        <p>The Attribute data structure has the following format:</p>
                        <table class="table table-striped">
                            <thead>
                            <th>Attribute field</th>
                            <th>Size (bytes)</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">Handle</th>
                                <td>2</td>
                                <td>A unique identifier assigned to each attribute, allowing devices to reference and interact with them.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">UUID</th>
                                <td>2 or 16</td>
                                <td>An identifier that uniquely identifies a specific attribute type, defining its purpose and characteristics.</td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">Value</th>
                                <td>Variable length</td>
                                <td>The actual data associated with an attribute, representing the information communicated between devices. </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">Permissions</th>
                                <td>Implementation specific</td>
                                <td>Access rights and restrictions governing how and attribute can be read, written, or otherwise interacted with by devices, ensuring security and control over the data exchange.</td>
                            </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>

                        <p>The ATT Protocol outlines methods for both reading and writing attributes. These methods involve ATT Protocol Data Unit (PDU) for communication.
                            In the context of the ATT protocol, a PDU represents the packet that is exchanged with the lower layer – specifically, the L2CAP layer.
                            This packet is then encapsulated for transmission over the physical link or sent to the upper layers.</p>
                        <p>Attribute PDUs have the following format:</p>
                        <table class="table table-striped">
                            <thead>
                            <th>Name</th>
                            <th>Size (bytes)</th>
                            <th>Description</th>
                            </thead>
                            <tbody>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">Attribute Opcode</th>
                                <td>1</td>

                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">Attribute Parameters</th>

                                    X = 13 if Authentication Signature Flag of the Attribute code is 1.
                                </td>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <th scope="row" class="no-wrap">Authentication Signature</th>
                                <td>0 or 12</td>
                                <td>Optional authentication signature for the Attribute Opcode and Attribute Parameters. </td>
                            </tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table>

                        <p>Let’s elaborate on the behavior of the ATT PDU called <code>Prepare Write Request</code>, as most of our findings are associated with this ATT PDU.</p>
                        <p>The <code>Prepare Write Request</code> ATT PDU is vital when dealing with the need to
                            write a long Attribute value, i.e., an attribute value where its size
                            exceeds (ATT_MTU - 1). The default Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) in
                            BLE communications is 23 bytes. This ATT PDU is used to request the server to
                            prepare the write of a value for a specified attribute. The server responds with a
                            <code>Prepare Write Response</code> to confirm the correct reception of the value. Multiple
                            <code>Prepare Write Request</code> ATT PDUs may be sent to transmit the complete Attribute
                            value. Once all the ATT PDUs have been transmitted, the client sends an <code>Execute Write Request</code> to instruct the server to write the value.</p>
                        <p>The format of the <code>Prepare Write Request</code> is as follows:</p>
                        <table class="table table-striped">

                        <p>The Generic Attribute Profile (GATT) establishes a service framework built
                            upon the ATT Protocol. This framework defines procedures and formats
                            for services and their characteristics are defined. These procedures encompass
                            various operations such as discovering, reading, writing characteristics but also notifying and indicating any characteristic value modification.
                            Additionally, GATT outlines procedures for configuring the
                            broadcast of characteristics. It also defines some <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/assigned-numbers.">standard profiles</a> with associated
                            services and characteristics.</p>
                        <p>The GATT Profile establishes the format for exchanging profile data, defining
                            fundamental elements such as services and characteristics within the structure.
                            These elements are encapsulated by Attributes, which serve as containers for
                            carrying profile data in the ATT Protocol.</p>

                        <h2>Attack scenarios</h2>
                        <p>After an in-depth study of the specification, 9 attack scenarios were defined.
                            The main goal of this study was to pinpoint corner cases and inaccuracies within
                            the specification, providing a foundation for the development of precise attack scenarios.</p>
                        <p>The description of the scenarios is provided in the related <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/conf-presentations/tree/master/Confs/Hardweario-NL-2024/2024-10-25-ble-gatt-fuzzing-paper-bboyer.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
                        <h2>Fuzzer</h2>
                        <p>The attack scenarios were implemented as fuzzing scripts in Python using the <em><a href="https://whad.io/">WHAD</a></em> framework.</p>
                        <p>We opted for <em>WHAD</em> as our chosen framework for its
                            specific capabilities in the BLE context. This framework equips us with all the
                            essential tools for testing the GATT layer, including transparent PDUs logging
                            and its own BLE stack implementation. It offers simple methods to create
                            and send BLE packets, encompassing the entire spectrum of ATT possibilities.
                            Additionally, it facilitates the seamless setup of a GATT server and enables
                            straightforward modification of its behavior.</p>
                        <p>The fuzzer architecture was designed with certain key choices in mind. One
                            notable decision involved the type of connection established during a fuzzing
                            session. Instead of initiating a new connection for each test case, we opted for
                            a single connection for the entire fuzzing session. This choice was driven by
                            the belief that retaining previous states of the stack could potentially aid in
                            triggering and identifying bugs. </p>
                        <p>We opted for a randomized approach to populate the ATT PDUs. An example illustrating the <code>Prepare Write Request</code> ATT PDU
                            mentioned earlier is provided below. Additionally, it is worth noting that each
                            fuzzing session focused solely on testing a single scenario.</p>

The description of the non-conformities and bugs is provided in the related <a href="https://github.com/quarkslab/conf-presentations/tree/master/Confs/Hardweario-NL-2024/2024-10-25-ble-gatt-fuzzing-paper-bboyer.pdf">paper</a>.</p>
                        <h3>Espressif GATT server example</h3>
                        <p>This vulnerability is associated with the Bluedroid stack provided in
                            the ESP-IDF framework. More specifically, it is related to the GATT server
                            example provided for Espressif devices, intended for using Bluedroid. This
                            vulnerability exposes a risk of heap overflow.</p>
                        <p>We uncovered this vulnerability during the code review of the Bluedroid
                            stack. Building on our prior discoveries of bugs, our aim was to assess the impact
                            on user applications. Upon scrutinizing the provided GATT server example, we
                            finally identified this Out-of-Bounds write issue.</p>
                        <p>Their initial misguided decision involves allowing the user to verify the
                            conformity of parameters provided in the <code>Prepare Write Request</code> ATT PDU by
                            default.</p>
                        <p>The root cause of the vulnerability was located in the <code>example_writ_event_env()</code> function during the copy of a received <code>Prepare Write Request</code>’s value
                            into the allocated buffer <code>prepare_buf</code> as we can see in the code below:</p>
                        <div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">memcpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">prepare_write_env</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">prepare_buf</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">+</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">param</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">write</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">offset</span><span class="p">,</span>

</code></pre></div>

                        <p>An attacker controls both the offset and the value and is able to write outside
                            of the allocated buffer. A check on the offset is actually done but only when the allocated
                            buffer has already been allocated, and therefore this check is not performed for
                            the first received <code>Prepare Write Request</code>.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, Espressif did not categorize this as a vulnerability within their
                            bounty program, treating it solely as a bug despite its clear manifestation as a
                            heap overflow issue. However, following our report, this vulnerability has been fixed in a timely manner by
                            Espressif without any communication about it, affecting 7 of their code examples.
                            We are curious to know about the number of applications that relied on
                            these code examples and remain susceptible to our discovery.</p>
                        <p>Espressif's response: "<em>Regarding the issue with the example memcopy, this problematic code segment is not present in the host and controller codes. It is solely included in the Example to demonstrate how the ESP API is used.

                        <p><strong>Denial of Service of NimBLE Bluetooth stack.</strong></p>
                        <p>During the analysis of the log files from our fuzzing campaign,
                            we observed instances where the device has terminated the connection by itself.
                            Upon further investigation, we identified a recurring pattern associated with
                            disconnections: transactions involving <code>Prepare Write Requests</code> that were not
                            completed within a 30-second timeframe.</p>
                        <p>Indeed, the BLE specification stipulates that "<em>A transaction not completed within 30 seconds shall time out. Such a transaction shall be considered to have failed, and the local higher layers shall be informed of this failure.</em>" <strong>[Spec Vol.3 Part.F 3.3.3]</strong>.
                            NimBLE implements this feature with the <code>BLE_ATT_SVR_QUEUE_WRITE_TMO</code> timer.</p>
                        <p>When the initiating device sends a <code>Prepare Write Request</code> to the BLE
                            peripheral, the NimBLE stack starts a timer to remove later the pending write
                            operations if no <code>Execute Write Request</code> or <code>Prepare Write Request</code> is received
                            within the specified time frame. If the initiating device disconnects from the
                            peripheral just before the timeout is reached, then the peripheral will be stuck
                            in an infinite loop and therefore will not advertise anymore even if the current
                            connection has been terminated. This lack of advertising prevents any new connections,
                            resulting in the device remaining unconnectable until it is reset.</p>

                        <p>We wanted to reproduce <a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-24746">CVE-2024-24746</a> on real-world devices. We opted for commonly available audio devices, including the <em>Sony WH-1000XM4</em>,
                            <em>WF-1000XM4</em> and <em>WH-1000XM5</em>, as some colleagues had these models on hand. We successfully managed to crash all these devices by attacking their exposed
                            BLE GATT servers in the same manner as we did with the NimBLE GATT server.</p>
                        <p>In the following, we will detail the Denial of Service attack process only for the <em>Sony WH-1000XM4</em>. Similar processes have been used for the <em>WF-1000XM4</em> and <em>WH-1000XM5</em>.</p>
                        <p>By default when used with Bluetooth Classic to listen to music, this device
                            like many Bluetooth audio devices exposes a BLE GATT server typically
                            labeled as LE_WH-1000XM4, featuring a range of characteristics with various
                            permissions. Our goal was to find an enabled <code>Prepare Write Request</code> characteristic.
                            We discovered the service with the 16-bit UUID FE2C, known as the <em>Fast Pair Service</em>, which is present
                            on many Bluetooth audio devices. This service has characteristics with write
                            permissions.</p>
                        <p>We noticed that following a <code>Prepare Write Request</code> with
                            an <code>Execute Write Request</code> caused the headset to disconnect by itself.
                            At this point, it became evident that we encountered a scenario similar to
                            the NimBLE DoS vulnerability.
                            After sending a single random request before each connection drop, we identified an
                            ATT PDU that consistently caused the device to crash after few try, a <code>Find By Type Value Request</code> with specific parameters.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>In this blog post, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the BLE specification, leading us to elaborate and implement attack scenarios using the <em>WHAD</em> framework.
                            Our research uncovered several non-conformities, bugs, and vulnerabilities across multiple BLE stacks, highlighting the need for more attention and improvement in these layers to enhance overall security.</p>

                            <li><strong>2023-12-29</strong> Espressif replied that impact of the first bug is just disconnection of the attached device, since it does not impact
                                normal use nor leak user data it cannot be considered a vulnerability. The second bug (OOB write) is not present in Host
                                or Controller code, it only affects example code and customers typically develop autonomously based on the API, so
                                the impact is minimal.</li>
